# Simple Password Generator

## Best Practices

* Make it long - at least 12-16 characters or more.
* Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* Avoid using personal information like birthdays, names, or common words that could be easily guessed.
* Create a unique password for each account.
* Consider using a passphrase.
* Use a password manager to store passwords.
* Enable two-factor or multi-factor authentication whenever possible.
* Avoid using common substitutions that are easy to guess.
* Don't use sequential numbers or letters, or repeat characters excessively.
* Change passwords regularly and never reuse old passwords.
